I am driven by a fundamental curiosity about how neural computations give rise to adaptive behaviour and cognition. My interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where I'm fascinated by the mechanisms that enable intelligent behavior. Through research experience in China, industry work in the Netherlands, and academic training in the UK, I have built multidisciplinary expertise spanning machine learning, neural engineering, large-scale data analysis and software engineering. These experiences have shaped my commitment to AI research and motivated me to develop novel transformative technologies with real‑world impact.
